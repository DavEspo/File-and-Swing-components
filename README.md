## SeekPosition file
This program asks the user to enter a file name, a position number, and number of characters to display. What the program does is read the file the user entered and display the number of characters the user entered starting from the position number the user entered. The input.txt file is given in this repository so this program could be tested using that file or any other text file put onto this downloaded folder onto a computer.
## ValidateCheckDigits file
This program reads the AcctNumsIn.txt file which contains a set of 15 six digit numbers. The program checks for whether each number in the file is valid or not. A number is valid only when the last digit of the number is equal to the remaider of the first 5 numbers added and then divided by 10. Valid numbers are written into the new file AcctNumsInAssessed.txt.
